get the basic game engine working with joystick input and having the character bounce off walls or rotate/swing round corners.

design the first level, keep it really simple - are we using blender for this ?

make a list of all game objects we need, such as walls/handles/doors/switches/spikes/holes/lights/powerups/oxygen etc

make the soundtrack and sound effects

draw some killer graphics

build the UI

develop the gameplay

constantly update dropbox/github - I will create a github page for us as a backup/code/gfx/audio revisioning

hourly meets on skype to discuss progress ? - if we are not all in the same room

wiki ? 

supplies to keep us going ? - tea, coffee, chocolate, haribo's, crisps, healthy food, water, kettle, microwave ?

please add anything to this list you can think of as important
